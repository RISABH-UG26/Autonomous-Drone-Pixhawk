### Submitting Code Changes

#### Before You Start

1. Check existing issues and pull requests to avoid duplicates
2. For major changes, open an issue first to discuss
3. Make sure you can test your changes safely
4. Keep safety as the top priority

#### Code Guidelines

**Safety First:**
- Never compromise safety features
- Add warnings for potentially dangerous changes
- Test thoroughly without propellers first

**Code Style:**
- Follow existing code formatting
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused and small

**Arduino Specific:**
- Maintain 250Hz loop timing
- Be mindful of memory usage (Arduino Uno has limited RAM)
- Use appropriate data types
- Avoid floating-point operations where possible
- Test on actual hardware

#### Pull Request Process

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make your changes**
   - Write clear, commented code
   - Test thoroughly on hardware
   - Update documentation if needed

4. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add: Brief description of changes"
   ```
   Use prefixes:
   - `Add:` for new features
   - `Fix:` for bug fixes
   - `Update:` for improvements
   - `Refactor:` for code restructuring
   - `Docs:` for documentation changes

5. **Push to your fork**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Describe what changes you made and why
   - Reference any related issues
   - Include test results
   - Add photos/videos of testing if relevant

### Testing Guidelines

**Essential Tests:**
- [ ] Code compiles without warnings
- [ ] Setup program completes successfully
- [ ] ESC calibration works correctly
- [ ] Motors respond properly (without props!)
- [ ] PID loops remain stable
- [ ] Loop timing stays at 4000Œºs
- [ ] All safety features work

**Flight Tests (if applicable):**
- [ ] Stable hover
- [ ] Responds correctly to all stick inputs
- [ ] Auto-level works properly
- [ ] Arming/disarming functions correctly
- [ ] No unexpected behavior
