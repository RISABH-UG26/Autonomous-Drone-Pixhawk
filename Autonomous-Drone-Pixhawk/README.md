- Displays receiver signals
- Shows quadcopter angles

### 3. Flight Controller
Main flight control program featuring:
- 250Hz refresh rate for precise control
- Complementary filter for angle estimation
- PID control loops for stabilization
- Auto-level and manual (rate) mode
- Battery voltage compensation

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation Steps

1. **Hardware Assembly**
   - Assemble your quadcopter frame
   - Mount the Arduino and connect all components according to pin configuration
   - Ensure proper motor rotation (CW/CCW pattern)

2. **Upload Setup Program**
   ```
   Open setup/setup.ino in Arduino IDE
   Upload to Arduino
   Open Serial Monitor (57600 baud)
   Follow on-screen instructions
   ```

3. **Calibrate ESCs**
   ```
   Open esc_calibrate/esc_calibrate.ino
   Upload to Arduino
   Follow ESC calibration procedure
   Test each motor individually
   ```

4. **Upload Flight Controller**
   ```
   Open Flight_controller/Flight_controller.ino
   Adjust PID values if needed (see Configuration section)
   Upload to Arduino
   ```

### First Flight Checklist
- [ ] All setup steps completed successfully
- [ ] ESCs calibrated and motors spinning correctly
- [ ] Propellers removed for testing
- [ ] Battery fully charged
- [ ] Open area for flight testing
- [ ] Gyroscope calibrated (don't move quad during startup)
- [ ] Transmitter properly bound to receiver

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### PID Tuning (in Flight_controller.ino)

```cpp
// Roll/Pitch PID Settings
float pid_p_gain_roll = 1.3;    // Proportional gain
float pid_i_gain_roll = 0.04;   // Integral gain
float pid_d_gain_roll = 18.0;   // Derivative gain
int pid_max_roll = 400;         // Maximum output

// Yaw PID Settings
float pid_p_gain_yaw = 4.0;
float pid_i_gain_yaw = 0.02;
float pid_d_gain_yaw = 0.0;
int pid_max_yaw = 400;

// Auto-level Mode
boolean auto_level = true;      // Set to false for rate mode
```

### Motor Configuration

Motors must be connected in the following pattern:
```
    Front
  1 ‚ñ≤ ‚ñ≤ 4
   CCW CW
     X
   CW CCW
  2     3
    Rear
```

### Arming/Disarming
- **Arm Motors**: Throttle low + Yaw left, then center yaw
- **Disarm Motors**: Throttle low + Yaw right

## üìä Technical Specifications

- **Control Loop Frequency**: 250Hz (4ms)
- **Gyroscope Range**: ¬±500¬∞/s
- **Accelerometer Range**: ¬±8g
- **PWM Output Range**: 1000-2000Œºs
- **Minimum Throttle**: 1100Œºs (motors running)
- **I2C Clock Speed**: 400kHz

## üîß Troubleshooting

### LED Status Indicators
- **Solid ON during startup**: Waiting for valid receiver signals
- **Blinking**: Gyroscope calibration in progress
- **ON after startup**: Loop time exceeded 4050Œºs (check code modifications)
- **Blinking fast**: Low battery voltage detected

### Common Issues

1. **Motors won't arm**
   - Ensure throttle is at minimum
   - Check receiver signal quality
   - Verify EEPROM configuration (run setup again)

2. **Unstable flight**
   - Recalibrate gyroscope
   - Adjust PID values
   - Check motor directions and propeller orientation
   - Verify CG (center of gravity)

3. **Drift in one direction**
   - Recalibrate accelerometer offsets
   - Ensure quadcopter is level during gyro calibration
   - Check motor/propeller balance
